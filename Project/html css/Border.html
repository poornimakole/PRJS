            Create an xml file containing personal details of user like (First Name, Last Name, City, and Contact No). Create a JSON file that contains project related details of user like (Project Id, Project Location). Fetch user’s personal details by clicking on ‘Get Personal Details’ and get project related details by clicking on ‘Get Project Details’. Display all the data fetched from server in a table on HTML page, as shown below. (Use Ajax Get request)
            Create a login page. Accept two inputs from user, ‘username’ and ‘password’. Compare the    username and password at server side and compare whether the user has logged in as administrator or not. If user has logged in as administrator, display an alert saying ‘You are logged in as administrator’. If user has logged in as normal user, then display an alert saying ‘You are not logged in as Administrator. You do not have rights to make any changes in the profile settings’. (Hint: Ajax POST request)
